# About
The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering ([OUSD R&E](https://www.cto.mil/)) inspired by DARPA's [Cyber Grand Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge) is kicking off a series of challenges to tackle some of the hardest shared challenges public, private and academic sectors face via  "micro-challenges".
The goals of these "micro-challenges" are to produce a community contributed set of forensic tools or unique data sets that can be transitioned back into one's day job, academic research, etc...

The next event is Battle of The Bots, and will be hosted at [BSides Charm](https://bsidescharm.org), April 29th and 30th.

# Battle of The Bots Overview
Battle of The Bots (BOTBs) is a reverse engineering and capability development competition where the competitor is tasked to reverse engineer custom services to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in said services.
Once access is gained to the vulnerable systems, the competitor will plant their team’s flag to score points.
A twist on this king-of-the-hill style competition is that services will be rotating throughout the competition.
Giving your bot the ability to “worm” through multiple services is critical for its survival! 


More on the blue team side? The BOTBs Staff will be capturing network traffic on the target environment to make available publicly after the competition.
## What types of challenges are we solving?

The vulnerable services competitors are tasked to exploit will be a mix of real off-the-shelf vulnerable services (ex: Log4Shell) or custom-built services to represent widely exploited vulnerabilities within commercial software.
This “CVE informed development” ensures that competitors are being tasked with realistic vulnerabilities and not fictitious “what-if” scenarios making your time investment at this competition beneficial to both blue teamers and red teamers alike. 

## New to Reversing and Capability Development?
Vulnerable services are written in a mix of interpreted and compiled languages allowing competitors of all skill levels to engage with the competition!
