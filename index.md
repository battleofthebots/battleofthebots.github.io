# About
The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering ([OUSD R&E](https://www.cto.mil/)) inspired by DARPA's [Cyber Grand Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge) is kicking off a series of challenges to tackle some of the hardest shared challenges public, private and academic sectors face via  "micro-challenges".
The goals of these "micro-challenges" are to produce a community contributed set of forensic tools or unique data sets that can be transitioned back into one's day job, academic research, etc...

The next event is Battle of The Bots, and will be hosted at [DEF CON]([https://bsidescharm.org](https://defcon.org/)), August 10th through 13th, 2023.
Have a question leading up to DEF CON? Join our Discord [here](https://www.discord.gg/PJEHwFFdzk). During the event we will be using the official DEF CON discord.

# Battle of The Bots Overview
Battle of The Bots (BOTB) is a reverse engineering and capability development competition where the competitor is tasked to identify and exploit custom and known vulnerabilities in a variety of services.
Once access is gained to the vulnerable systems, the competitor's bot must worm through the network pwning new services and planting your flag.

An upload portal will be provided to drop and unleash your worm into an offline network to compromise a group of services. Each group of services is a referred to as a "map". 

## Maps

### Mainframe Madness
Do you miss the good ol' days of hacking when everything was just text flying around the unencrypted web? Then Mainframe Madeness is the map for you. Pwn everything from basic backdoors to telnet games to get your bot through the "mainframe".

### CVE City
Modern services with modern tech-stacks, CVE City will test your ability to write you own POCs for basic CVEs and common exploitation techniques.

### Spacepunk
Spacepunk is a small but challenging map meant to test your pwning skills. Craft exploits and shellcode on custom binaries to hack your way through time!

## Bots

Each team must build a bot to automatically exploit given services and then propogate onto the next host. The bot must be completely self-contained and work offline. The environment will include all the popular python libraries and useful commandline utilities needed for the competition.

A list of what is installed can be found in the [BOTB Base Image Repo](https://github.com/battleofthebots/botb-base-image).
