# About
The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering ([OUSD R&E](https://www.cto.mil/)) inspired by DARPA's [Cyber Grand Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-grand-challenge) is kicking off a series of challenges to tackle some of the hardest shared challenges public, private and academic sectors face via  "micro-challenges". The goals of these "micro-challenges" are to produce a community contributed set of forensic tools or unique data sets that can be transitioned back into one's day job, academic research, etc...

# Battle of The Bots Overview
Battle of The Bots (BOTB) is a reverse engineering and capability development competition where competitors are tasked with identifying and exploiting custom and known vulnerabilities in a variety of services. Competitors must then use the capabilities and exploits they have developed to gain access and pivot through  branching networks that comprise a "map."

* CTF Challenges from DEF CON 31 can be found on the Battle of The Bots [public github repo](https://github.com/battleofthebots). 


# Building Micro-CGC Events
The Micro-CGC team wanted to publish a "lessons learned" document to help fellow CTF event planners.
For a comprehensive breakdown on everything from "what's a good challenge" to vulnerability scanning the CTF environment itself, take a look [here](https://battleofthebots.net/building_micro_cgc_events.html).
